msgid "**Long-term drought**: Droughts that persist for many months or years and impact hydrological systems, groundwater, ecosystems and socio-economic systems. Long- term droughts are typically associated with cumulative rainfall deficits over extended periods. The Bulletin monitors long-term drought using the 12-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-12), which captures rainfall deficit over the past 12 months."

Current drought conditions are described using two metrics, the Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) and the 12-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-12), which are intended to characterise the drought hazard from fast (short-term) and slow (long-term) processes respectively."
