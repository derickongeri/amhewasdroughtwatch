"The Africa Drought Watch (ADW) Bulletin is Africa’s resource for tracking"
" and anticipating drought conditions across the continent. Produced "
"monthly by the African Union Commission through the Africa Multi-Hazard "
"Early Warning and Action System (AMHEWAS) programme, the bulletin "
"provides timely insights to inform preparedness, anticipatory action, "
"response, recovery and policy decisions for longer-term resilience "
"building. The ADW is a monthly drought monitoring and early warning "
"product providing a holistic and comprehensive analysis and overview of "
"ongoing short-term and long-term (link to section) drought conditions and"
" associated impacts across the African continent. By integrating seasonal"
" forecasts information, the bulletin provides an overview/estimation of "
"projected impacts and trends, informing proactive/anticipatory action and"
" response and resilience building. To ensure inclusivity the ADW bulletin"
" is generated through a collaborative and inclusive approach through co-"
"production process that brings together continental and regional AMHEWAS "
"situation rooms, RECS and RCCs."

"Africa faces more frequent, severe, and prolonged droughts. Drought "
"monitoring and early warning are critical in mitigating and managing "
"drought risks and drought emergencies. Africa needs to be better "
"prepared. The Drought Bulletin helps: - Trigger anticipatory action "
"before impacts escalate - Inform regional coordination and cross-border "
"response - Support long-term planning and investment in resilience With "
"timely, science-based alerts, we move from reacting to anticipating."

"The Drought Bulletin is a monthly publication offering: - Continental "
"drought monitoring using satellite, ground data, and regional expertise -"
" Drought risk outlooks for the months ahead - Policy-relevant messages to"
" inform early action and coordination - Visuals and maps to quickly "
"interpret severity and spread Whether you’re a policymaker, humanitarian "
"responder, or researcher, the bulletin supports early decision-making and"
" resilience building."

"**Drought**: A prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a "
"shortage of water that can negatively impact agriculture, ecosystems, and"
" human activities"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/index.rst:103
msgid ""
"**Combined Drought Indicator (CDI)**: A multi-variable index used to "
"monitor and assess drought conditions by integrating information from "
"various hydrological and biophysical variables. It is particularly "
"valuable in identifying and tracking agricultural drought, which directly"
" impacts vegetation and crop health. Instead of relying on a single "
"drought indicator, ADW CDI combines three indicators namely: - "
"Standardized Precipitation Index: (SPI-1, SPI-3) - Soil moisture anomaly:"
" (monthly) - Vegetation productivity anomaly using Fraction of Absorbed "
"Photosynthenticaly Active Radiation (fAPAR): (dekadal)"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/index.rst:108
msgid ""
"**Short-term drought**: is a period of unusually dry weather that "
"typically lasts from a few weeks to a few months, caused by a significant"
" rainfall deficit that primarily affects topsoil moisture and surface "
"water sources, often affecting agriculture and ecosystems and increasing "
"wildfire risk. The Bulletin monitors short-term drought using the "
"Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) that integrates rainfall deficit (SPI-1,"
" SPI-3), soil moisture anomaly, and reduced vegetation productivity "
"(fAPAR)"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/index.rst:110
msgid ""
"**Long-term drought**: Droughts that persist for many months or years and"
" impact hydrological systems, groundwater, ecosystems and socio-economic "
"systems. Long-term droughts are typically associated with cumulative "
"rainfall deficits over extended periods. The Bulletin monitors long-term "
"drought using the 12-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-12), "
"which captures rainfall deficit over the past 12 months."

msgid "**Types of drought**:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/index.rst:114
msgid ""
"**Meteorological**: a significant reduction in rainfall compared to the "
"long-term average for a specific region and time period. It is the "
"earliest signal of drought, typically measured using indicators like the "
"Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-1)"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/index.rst:115
msgid ""
"**Agricultural**: occurs when reduced rainfall and soil moisture limit "
"crop growth, pasture quality, or agricultural productivity. It reflects "
"impact on farming and food systems, and may lag behind meteorological "
"drought"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/index.rst:116
msgid ""
"**Hydrological**: results from prolonged precipitation deficits that lead"
" to reduced streamflow, groundwater levels, reservoir storage, and water "
"availability. It affects water supply systems, energy production, and "
"ecosystem health and typically develops slowly but lasts longer."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/index.rst:117
msgid ""
"**Socio-economic**: arises when water shortages begin to affect people’s "
"daily lives, income and services. It occurs when drought conditions "
"reduce availability of water for households, agriculture, energy, health "
"care, or markets – leading to price hikes, job losses, increased hardship"
" in communities and strain on public services. In the most affected "
"areas, it can result in forced migration, displacement or conflict over "
"scare resources."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/index.rst:118
msgid ""
"**Ecological drought**: occurs when prolonged water shortages disrupt "
"ecosystems – reducing the health, functioning or services provided by "
"forests, wetlands, rangelands or aquatic systems. It can lead to "
"vegetation dieback, wildlife stress or migration, biodiversity loss, and "
"increased vulnerability to wildfires and invasive species. Unlike other "
"drought types focused on people or crops, ecological drought highlights "
"the impacts on nature itself, and how drought threatens the long-term "
"balance of ecosystems."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/index.rst:121
msgid ""
"**Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)**: The Standardized "
"Precipitation Index, or SPI, is a drought index that captures how "
"observed precipitation deviates from the climatological average over a "
"given time period."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/index.rst:125
msgid ""
"**Soil Moisture Anomaly**: Assesses the deviation of soil moisture from "
"its long-term average, directly indicating water availability for plants "
"and agricultural drought"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/index.rst:127
msgid ""
"**Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) "
"Anomaly**: Derived from satellite observations, this measures how much "
"solar radiation vegetation is absorbing for photosynthesis. Anomalies in "
"FAPAR can indicate vegetation stress due to water scarcity"

"The ADW maps give information about drought hazards that could pose a "
"risk to human communities. Current drought conditions are described using"
" two metrics, the Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) and the 12-month "
"Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-12) which are intended to "
"characterise the drought hazard from fast (short-term) and slow (long-"
"term) processes respectively. CDI combines information on precipitation "
"anomaly, soil moisture anomaly and vegetation anomaly, thus highlighting "
"conditions associated with meteorological and agricultural drought. The "
"SPI-12 is associated with hydrological drought. The bulletin integrates "
"multiple data sources and expert input: - Satellite-derived and model-"
"based drought indices (e.g., SPI, fAPAR, soil moisture) - Seasonal "
"forecasts from RCCs and Global Centers - Impact assessments - Co-"
"production with technical experts and end-users Data is analyzed "
"regionally and validated through collaboration with RECs, RCCs, and "
"national agencies."
