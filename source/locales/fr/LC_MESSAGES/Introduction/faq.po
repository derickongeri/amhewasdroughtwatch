msgid "Who produces the drought bulletin?"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:9
msgid ""
"The Drought Bulletin is produced by the African Union Commission (AUC) "
"through the AMHEWAS programme, using a collaborative and inclusive co-"
"production process. It brings together expertise from continental and "
"regional AMHEWAS Situation Rooms, Regional Economic Communities (RECs), "
"and Regional Climate Centres (RCCs) to ensure that the bulletin reflects "
"ground realities, scientific accuracy, and the needs of diverse "
"stakeholders."

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:14
msgid "How often is the bulletin produced?"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:16
msgid ""
"The drought bulletin is produced and disseminated monthly, offering a "
"timely analysis of current drought conditions across Africa. Each "
"publication also includes a forward-looking outlook based on seasonal "
"forecasts, highlighting potential drought risks in the months ahead."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:21
msgid "What is the definition of drought?"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:23
msgid ""
"A prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a shortage of "
"water that can negatively impact agriculture, ecosystems, and human "
"activities. Drought is about deviation from the norm, not just how dry or"
" wet a place usually is."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:28
msgid ""
"How should I interpret the AMHEWAS drought levels, and what do the "
"different map colors mean?"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:30
msgid ""
"The AMHEWAS drought levels provide a standardized way to assess the "
"severity of drought conditions, their potential impacts, and the "
"governance level responsible for response and coordination. The scale "
"moves from early monitoring to full-scale emergency response, guiding "
"both technical experts and decision-makers:"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:32
msgid ""
"**Level 1 (light green)** - Early signs of below-average rainfall; "
"limited impacts. Close monitoring is recommended. Monitoring by technical"
" agencies at sub-national level."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:33
msgid ""
"**Level 2 (yellow)** - Rainfall deficits are increasing; early signs of "
"stress on crops, pasture, or water supplies. Sectoral ministries and "
"local authorities begin preparedness measures and inter-agency cross-"
"sector coordination."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:34
msgid ""
"**Level 3 (orange)** - Severe drought impacts confirmed; livelihoods, "
"food security, and water supply affected. Requires national-level "
"coordination, activation of contingency plans, possible resource "
"mobilization and intensified response. Regional-level coordination may be"
" required."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:35
msgid ""
"**Level 4 (red)** - Extreme and widespread drought with multi-sectoral "
"and humanitarian impacts. Triggers regional and continental coordination "
"through RECs, AMHEWAS Situation Rooms, and the African Union. "
"International support may be mobilized."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:37
msgid ""
"These levels are based on scientific indicators, impact reports, and "
"expert input, ensuring that appropriate action is taken at the right "
"level and time."

msgid ""
"Why is long-term drought or hydrological drought important when looking "
"at current drought?"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:45
msgid ""
"Long-term or hydrological drought is crucial for understanding the full "
"picture of drought risk. While short-term drought affects soil moisture "
"and crops, long-term drought reflects cumulative water deficits over "
"months or years—impacting rivers, groundwater, reservoirs, and "
"ecosystems. These sustained shortages strain drinking water supplies, "
"irrigation systems, energy generation, public health, and food security."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:47
msgid ""
"Even if rains return briefly, long-term drought conditions can persist, "
"delaying recovery and deepening vulnerabilities."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:49
msgid ""
"This is especially important for guiding strategic action. Long-term "
"drought conditions can signal the need for water restrictions, "
"infrastructure investments, livelihood support, and long-term planning. "
"They help governments and humanitarian actors distinguish between "
"temporary dry spells and prolonged water crises that require sustained, "
"system-wide responses."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:51
msgid ""
"**In short:** long-term drought monitoring supports informed decisions "
"that build resilience, not just emergency response."

msgid "Can desert and tropical forest areas experience drought?"
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:59
msgid ""
"Yes. Drought can affect both deserts and tropical forests, even though "
"they represent opposite ends of the climate spectrum."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:61
msgid ""
"In desert regions, drought occurs when rainfall falls significantly below"
" the already-low average—disrupting fragile ecosystems, water access, and"
" pastoralist livelihoods."
msgstr ""

#: ../source/Introduction/faq.rst:63
msgid ""
"In tropical forest areas, drought may seem unlikely because these regions"
" typically receive abundant rainfall. However, drought can still occur "
"when there is a sharp and prolonged reduction in the expected amount of "
"rain — even if some rain still falls. This can stress forest ecosystems, "
"increase wildfire risk, reduce river flows, and impact agriculture and "
"hydropower."
