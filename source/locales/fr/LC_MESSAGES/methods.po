"**Long-term drought**: Droughts that persist for many months or years and"
" impact hydrological systems, groundwater, ecosystems and socio-economic "
"systems. Long- term droughts are typically associated with cumulative "
"rainfall deficits over extended periods. The Bulletin monitors long-term "
"drought using the 12-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-12), "
"which captures rainfall deficit over the past 12 months."

"The ADW maps give information about drought hazards that could pose a "

" two metrics, the Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) and the 12-month "
