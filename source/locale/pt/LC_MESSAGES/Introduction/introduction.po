"The Africa Drought Watch (ADW) Bulletin is Africa’s resource for tracking"
" and anticipating drought conditions across the continent. Produced "
"monthly by the African Union Commission through the Africa Multi-Hazard "
"Early Warning and Action System (AMHEWAS) programme, the bulletin "
"provides timely insights to inform preparedness, anticipatory action, "
"response, recovery and policy decisions for longer-term resilience "
"building."

"The ADW is a monthly drought monitoring and early warning product "
"providing a holistic and comprehensive analysis/overview/situation-"
"overview of ongoing short-term and long-term (link to section) drought "
"conditions and associated impacts across the African continent. By "
"integrating seasonal forecasts information, the bulletin provides an "
"overview/estimation of projected impacts and trends, informing "
"proactive/anticipatory action and response and resilience building."
