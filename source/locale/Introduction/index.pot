msgid "The Africa Drought Watch (ADW) Bulletin is Africa’s resource for tracking and anticipating drought conditions across the continent. Produced monthly by the African Union Commission through the Africa Multi-Hazard Early Warning and Action System (AMHEWAS) programme, the bulletin provides timely insights to inform preparedness, anticipatory action, response, recovery and policy decisions for longer-term resilience building. The ADW is a monthly drought monitoring and early warning product providing a holistic and comprehensive analysis/overview/situation-overview of ongoing short-term and long-term (link to section) drought conditions and associated impacts across the African continent. By integrating seasonal forecasts information, the bulletin provides an overview/estimation of projected impacts and trends, informing proactive/anticipatory action and response and resilience building. To ensure inclusivity the ADW bulletin is generated through a collaborative and inclusive approach through co-production process that brings together continental and regional AMHEWAS situation rooms, RECS and RCCs."
