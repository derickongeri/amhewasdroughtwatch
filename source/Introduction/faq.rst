Frequently Asked Questions
=============================

.. _who-produces:

Who produces the drought bulletin?
----------------------------------

The Drought Bulletin is produced by the African Union Commission (AUC) through the AMHEWAS programme, using a collaborative and inclusive co-production process. It brings together expertise from continental and regional AMHEWAS Situation Rooms, Regional Economic Communities (RECs), and Regional Climate Centres (RCCs) to ensure that the bulletin reflects ground realities, scientific accuracy, and the needs of diverse stakeholders.

.. _how-often:

How often is the bulletin produced?
-----------------------------------

The drought bulletin is produced and disseminated monthly, offering a timely analysis of current drought conditions across Africa. Each publication also includes a forward-looking outlook based on seasonal forecasts, highlighting potential drought risks in the months ahead.

.. _definition-of-drought:

What is the definition of drought?
----------------------------------

A prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a shortage of water that can negatively impact agriculture, ecosystems, and human activities. Drought is about deviation from the norm, not just how dry or wet a place usually is.

.. _amhewas-drought-levels:

How should I interpret the AMHEWAS drought levels, and what do the different map colors mean?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The AMHEWAS drought levels provide a standardized way to assess the severity of drought conditions, their potential impacts, and the governance level responsible for response and coordination. The scale moves from early monitoring to full-scale emergency response, guiding both technical experts and decision-makers:

- **Level 1 (light green)** - Early signs of below-average rainfall; limited impacts. Close monitoring is recommended. Monitoring by technical agencies at sub-national level.
- **Level 2 (yellow)** - Rainfall deficits are increasing; early signs of stress on crops, pasture, or water supplies. Sectoral ministries and local authorities begin preparedness measures and inter-agency cross-sector coordination.
- **Level 3 (orange)** - Severe drought impacts confirmed; livelihoods, food security, and water supply affected. Requires national-level coordination, activation of contingency plans, possible resource mobilization and intensified response. Regional-level coordination may be required.
- **Level 4 (red)** - Extreme and widespread drought with multi-sectoral and humanitarian impacts. Triggers regional and continental coordination through RECs, AMHEWAS Situation Rooms, and the African Union. International support may be mobilized.

These levels are based on scientific indicators, impact reports, and expert input, ensuring that appropriate action is taken at the right level and time.


.. _long-term-drought:

Why is long-term drought or hydrological drought important when looking at current drought?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Long-term or hydrological drought is crucial for understanding the full picture of drought risk. While short-term drought affects soil moisture and crops, long-term drought reflects cumulative water deficits over months or years—impacting rivers, groundwater, reservoirs, and ecosystems. These sustained shortages strain drinking water supplies, irrigation systems, energy generation, public health, and food security.

Even if rains return briefly, long-term drought conditions can persist, delaying recovery and deepening vulnerabilities.

This is especially important for guiding strategic action. Long-term drought conditions can signal the need for water restrictions, infrastructure investments, livelihood support, and long-term planning. They help governments and humanitarian actors distinguish between temporary dry spells and prolonged water crises that require sustained, system-wide responses.

**In short:** long-term drought monitoring supports informed decisions that build resilience, not just emergency response.


.. _drought-in-forests-deserts:

Can desert and tropical forest areas experience drought?
--------------------------------------------------------

Yes. Drought can affect both deserts and tropical forests, even though they represent opposite ends of the climate spectrum.

In desert regions, drought occurs when rainfall falls significantly below the already-low average—disrupting fragile ecosystems, water access, and pastoralist livelihoods.

In tropical forest areas, drought may seem unlikely because these regions typically receive abundant rainfall. However, drought can still occur when there is a sharp and prolonged reduction in the expected amount of rain — even if some rain still falls. This can stress forest ecosystems, increase wildfire risk, reduce river flows, and impact agriculture and hydropower.

Drought is about deviation from the norm, not just how dry or wet a place usually is.
