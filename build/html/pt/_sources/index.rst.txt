.. **Tracking Drought. Informing Action. Empowering Decisions**

The Africa Drought Watch (ADW) Bulletin is Africa’s resource for tracking and anticipating drought conditions across the continent. Produced monthly by the African Union Commission through the Africa Multi-Hazard Early Warning and Action System (AMHEWAS) programme, the bulletin provides timely insights to inform preparedness, anticipatory action, response, recovery and policy decisions for longer-term resilience building. The ADW is a monthly drought monitoring and early warning product providing a holistic and comprehensive analysis and overview of ongoing short-term and long-term (link to section) drought conditions and associated impacts across the African continent. By integrating seasonal forecasts information, the bulletin provides an overview/estimation of projected impacts and trends, informing proactive/anticipatory action and response and resilience building. To ensure inclusivity the ADW bulletin is generated through a collaborative and inclusive approach through co-production process that brings together continental and regional AMHEWAS situation rooms, RECS and RCCs.

Why it matters
---------------

Africa faces more frequent, severe, and prolonged droughts. Drought monitoring and early warning are critical in mitigating and managing drought risks and drought emergencies. Africa needs to be better prepared. The Drought Bulletin helps:
- Trigger anticipatory action before impacts escalate
- Inform regional coordination and cross-border response
- Support long-term planning and investment in resilience
With timely, science-based alerts, we move from reacting to anticipating.



What is the Bulletin?
----------------------

The Drought Bulletin is a monthly publication offering:
- Continental drought monitoring using satellite, ground data, and regional expertise
- Drought risk outlooks for the months ahead
- Policy-relevant messages to inform early action and coordination
- Visuals and maps to quickly interpret severity and spread
Whether you’re a policymaker, humanitarian responder, or researcher, the bulletin supports
early decision-making and resilience building.

Definitions and Terminology
----------------------------

- **Drought**: A prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a shortage of water
  that can negatively impact agriculture, ecosystems, and human activities

- **Combined Drought Indicator (CDI)**: A multi-variable index used to monitor and assess drought conditions by integrating information from various hydrological and biophysical variables. It is particularly valuable in identifying and tracking agricultural drought, which directly impacts vegetation and crop health. Instead of relying on a single drought indicator, ADW CDI combines three indicators namely:
  - Standardized Precipitation Index: (SPI-1, SPI-3)
  - Soil moisture anomaly: (monthly)
  - Vegetation productivity anomaly using Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthenticaly Active Radiation (fAPAR): (dekadal)

- **Short-term drought**: is a period of unusually dry weather that typically lasts from a few weeks to a few months, caused by a significant rainfall deficit that primarily affects topsoil moisture and surface water sources, often affecting agriculture and ecosystems and increasing wildfire risk. The Bulletin monitors short-term drought using the Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) that integrates rainfall deficit (SPI-1, SPI-3), soil moisture anomaly, and reduced vegetation productivity (fAPAR)

- **Long-term drought**: Droughts that persist for many months or years and impact hydrological systems, groundwater, ecosystems and socio-economic systems. Long-term droughts are typically associated with cumulative rainfall deficits over extended periods. The Bulletin monitors long-term drought using the 12-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-12), which captures rainfall deficit over the past 12 months.

- **Types of drought**:
  
   - **Meteorological**: a significant reduction in rainfall compared to the long-term average for a specific region and time period. It is the earliest signal of drought, typically measured using indicators like the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-1)
   - **Agricultural**: occurs when reduced rainfall and soil moisture limit crop growth, pasture quality, or agricultural productivity. It reflects impact on farming and food systems, and may lag behind meteorological drought
   - **Hydrological**: results from prolonged precipitation deficits that lead to reduced streamflow, groundwater levels, reservoir storage, and water availability. It affects water supply systems, energy production, and ecosystem health and typically develops slowly but lasts longer.
   - **Socio-economic**: arises when water shortages begin to affect people’s daily lives, income and services. It occurs when drought conditions reduce availability of water for households, agriculture, energy, health care, or markets – leading to price hikes, job losses, increased hardship in communities and strain on public services. In the most affected areas, it can result in forced migration, displacement or conflict over scare resources.
   - **Ecological drought**: occurs when prolonged water shortages disrupt ecosystems – reducing the health, functioning or services provided by forests, wetlands, rangelands or aquatic systems. It can lead to vegetation dieback, wildlife stress or migration, biodiversity loss, and increased vulnerability to wildfires and invasive species. Unlike other drought types focused on people or crops, ecological drought highlights the impacts on nature itself, and how drought threatens the long-term balance of ecosystems. 


- **Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)**: The Standardized Precipitation Index, or SPI, is
  a drought index that captures how observed precipitation deviates from the
  climatological average over a given time period.

- **Soil Moisture Anomaly**: Assesses the deviation of soil moisture from its long-term average, directly indicating water availability for plants and agricultural drought

- **Fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) Anomaly**: Derived from satellite observations, this measures how much solar radiation vegetation is absorbing for photosynthesis. Anomalies in FAPAR can indicate vegetation stress due to water scarcity


Methodology
------------

The ADW maps give information about drought hazards that could pose a risk to human communities. Current drought conditions are described using two metrics, the Combined Drought Indicator (CDI) and the 12-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-12) which are intended to characterise the drought hazard from fast (short-term) and slow (long-term) processes respectively. CDI combines information on precipitation anomaly, soil moisture anomaly and vegetation anomaly, thus highlighting conditions associated with meteorological and agricultural drought. The SPI-12 is associated with hydrological drought. 
The bulletin integrates multiple data sources and expert input:
- Satellite-derived and model-based drought indices (e.g., SPI, fAPAR, soil moisture)
- Seasonal forecasts from RCCs and Global Centers
- Impact assessments 
- Co-production with technical experts and end-users
Data is analyzed regionally and validated through collaboration with RECs, RCCs, and national agencies.
