Definitions and Terminology
============================

- **Drought**: A prolonged period of abnormally low rainfall, leading to a shortage of water
  that can negatively impact agriculture, ecosystems, and human activities

- **Combined Drought Indicator (CDI)**: An integrated indicator combining precipitation,
  soil moisture and vegetation conditions to provide a holistic drought severity
  classification

- **Short-term drought**:

- **Long-term drought**: Droughts that persist for many months or years and impact
  hydrological systems, groundwater, ecosystems and socio-economic systems. Long-
  term droughts are typically associated with cumulative rainfall deficits over extended
  periods. The Bulletin monitors long-term drought using the 12-month Standardized
  Precipitation Index (SPI-12), which captures rainfall deficit over the past 12 months.

- **Types of drought**:
  
  - Meteorological
  - Agricultural
  - Hydrological
  - Ecological
  - Socio-economic

- **Ecosystem drought**: ?

- **Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)**: The Standardized Precipitation Index, or SPI, is
  a drought index that captures how observed precipitation deviates from the
  climatological average over a given time period.



Methodology
------------

The ADW maps give information about drought hazards that could pose a risk to human
communities. Current drought conditions are described using two metrics, the Combined
Drought Indicator (CDI) and the 12-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI-12), which are
intended to characterise the drought hazard from fast (short-term) and slow (long-term)
processes respectively.

- **CDI** combines information on precipitation anomaly, soil moisture anomaly and vegetation anomaly, thus highlighting conditions associated with meteorological and agricultural drought.

- **SPI-12** is associated with hydrological drought.

The bulletin integrates multiple data sources and expert input:

- Satellite-derived and model-based drought indices (e.g., SPI, fAPAR, soil moisture)
- Seasonal forecasts from RCCs and Global Centers
- Impact assessments
- Co-production with technical experts and end-users

Data is analyzed regionally and validated through collaboration with RECs, RCCs, and national
agencies.
